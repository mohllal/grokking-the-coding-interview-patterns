# Simplify Path

## Problem Description

Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which begins with a slash `'/'`, transform this path into its **simplified canonical path**.

The rules are:

- A single period `'.'` represents the current directory
- A double period `'..'` represents the parent directory
- Multiple consecutive slashes `'//'` are treated as a single slash
- Any other format of periods (e.g., `'...'`) is treated as a directory name

The canonical path should:

- Start with a single slash `'/'`
- Directories separated by a single slash `'/'`
- Not end with a trailing slash (unless it's the root)
- Not have any `.` or `..` components

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
```

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
```

**Example 3:**

```plaintext
Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
```

**Example 4:**

```plaintext
Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going up from root stays at root
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
- `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'`, or underscore `'_'`
- `path` is a valid absolute Unix path

## Solution

### Intuition

A stack naturally handles the parent directory (`..`) operation: push directories, pop on `..`. Split the path by `/`, process each component, and join the final stack.

### Algorithm

1. Split path by `'/'` and filter out empty strings and `'.'`
2. For each remaining component:
   - If `'..'`: pop from stack (if not empty)
   - Otherwise: push directory name onto stack
3. Join stack with `'/'` and prepend `'/'`

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ — process each character once
- **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ — stack may hold all directory names

```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        # Split the path by '/' and remove:
        # - empty parts (caused by '//' or leading '/')
        # - '.' since it represents the current directory
        components = [part for part in path.split("/") if part and part != "."]

        stack = []
        for part in components:
            if part == "..":
                # ".." means go up one directory
                # Only pop if there is a directory to go back from
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                # Valid directory name, push onto the stack
                stack.append(part)

        # Rebuild the canonical path from the stack
        # Always starts with a root '/'
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
